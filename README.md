# Convolutional-Variational-Autoencoder

In this repository, I have implemented variational autoencoder(convolutional) to generate desired images from their respective given images<br/>
 <br/>
 
 Steps involved in data preprocessing:-<br/>
   you can build the dataset organized in a way such that:- <br/>
    1. input image folder<br/>
    2. ground truth image folder<br/>
 <br/>
   Normalize the data<br/>
   <br/>
   Split the data into train and validation<br/>
 
 Dataset is private so i cannot give more information about that.<br/>
 <br/>
 That's it.<br/>
 <br/>
 Go through the notebook for more details and implementation.
